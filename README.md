# Stroke Prediction (HooHacks Submission)

Strokes remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Thus, being able to predict one's risk of having a stroke is paramount to addressing this crisis. This project attempts to leverage the power of various machine learning classification models to determine trends in data that assist in such prediction. It also provides a web app that users can interact with to easily determine a model's prediction regarding their chance of having a stroke.
